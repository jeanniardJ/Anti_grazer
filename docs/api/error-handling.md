# Error Handling

This document outlines the error handling strategy and responses for the Anti Grazer API. A well-defined error handling mechanism is crucial for diagnosing issues, informing clients of problems, and ensuring a robust API.

## Error Response Format

When an error occurs, the Anti Grazer API will respond with a structured error object. This object contains information about the error, making it easier for clients to understand the problem and take appropriate action.

The typical error response will look like this:

```json
{
    "error": {
        "code": "ERROR_CODE",
        "message": "Error description",
        "details": "Additional information about the error"
    }
}
```

- `code`: A short, alphanumeric code identifying the error.
- `message`: A human-readable message explaining the error.
- `details`: (Optional) Additional information or context about the error.

## HTTP Status Codes

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. Here are some common status codes used:

- `200 OK`: The request was successful.
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was invalid or cannot be served.
- `401 Unauthorized`: The request lacks valid authentication credentials.
- `403 Forbidden`: The client does not have the necessary permissions.
- `404 Not Found`: The requested resource could not be found.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on the server.

## Common Error Codes

Here are some common error codes and their meanings:

- `INVALID_REQUEST`: The request is malformed or missing required parameters.
- `NOT_FOUND`: The requested resource does not exist.
- `UNAUTHORIZED`: The client is not authorized to perform the action.
- `FORBIDDEN`: The action is forbidden for the current user.

## Error Logging

Errors are logged on the server to aid in debugging and monitoring. Logs include information such as the error code, message, details, request URL, client IP address, and timestamp.

## Error Recovery

Clients should implement error recovery mechanisms, such as retrying the request, displaying an error message to the user, or logging the error for further analysis.

## Rate Limiting Errors

If rate limiting is in place, clients may receive errors indicating that they have exceeded their rate limits. These errors should be handled gracefully, and clients should back off and retry the requests later.

```json
{
    "error": {
        "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
        "message": "You have exceeded your rate limit. Try again later."
    }
}
```

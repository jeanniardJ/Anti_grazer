## Introduction

Accessibility is about ensuring an equivalent user experience for all people, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Ensuring our application is accessible, means it can be used by a broader audience, including those with disabilities such as visual impairment, hearing loss, cognitive impairments, and motor disabilities.

## Accessibility Standards

We strive to comply with the following accessibility standards:

- **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG):** We aim to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards as a minimum, striving for AAA where possible.
- **Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA):** Utilize ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility where HTML5 elements and attributes fall short.

## Testing for Accessibility

Regular accessibility testing is conducted to identify and rectify any accessibility issues. This includes manual testing, automated testing using tools like Axe or Lighthouse, and user testing with individuals who have disabilities.

## Keyboard Accessibility

Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible and that users can navigate through the application using the keyboard alone.

## Screen Reader Compatibility

Ensure compatibility with various screen readers, providing text alternatives for all non-text content, meaningful sequence, and contextually relevant information.

## Color Contrast and Text

Maintain a high color contrast ratio between text and background colors. Ensure text is resizable without loss of content or functionality.

## Interactive Elements

Clearly indicate interactive elements, and ensure they provide feedback when interacted with. This includes links, buttons, form elements, and other controls.

## Forms and Input

Provide clear and informative error messages, label all form fields, and provide instructions and cues to help users understand how to complete the form.

## Multimedia

Provide text alternatives for multimedia, including captions for videos and transcripts for audio.

## Pre-requisites

- Ensure all tests pass on the `main` branch before initiating a deployment.
- Verify that the configuration for production is updated and correct.

## Deployment Environments

- **Staging Environment**: A replica of the production environment where the final testing is performed before going live.
- **Production Environment**: The live application where end-users interact with the system.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Create a Release**: Tag the `main` branch with a new release version, following semantic versioning.
2. **Build**: Build the application for production.
3. **Deploy to Staging**: Deploy the build to the staging environment.
4. **Testing**: Perform any necessary testing on the staging environment.
5. **Deploy to Production**: Once everything has been tested and verified, deploy the build to the production environment.
6. **Verify**: Verify the deployment in production to ensure everything is working as expected.

## Monitoring and Rollback

- Monitor the applicationâ€™s performance, error rates, and other important metrics.
- If any issues are identified post-deployment, initiate a rollback to the previous stable version.

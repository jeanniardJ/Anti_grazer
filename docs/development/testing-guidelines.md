# Testing Guidelines

Testing is a crucial part of the development process in the Anti Grazer project. This document outlines the guidelines and best practices for writing tests.

## General Guidelines

- Write tests to cover new or modified functionality.
- Keep tests simple, readable, and descriptive.
- Use meaningful names for test cases and test methods.
- Group related tests together within the same test suite.

## Unit Testing

- Write unit tests to verify the correctness of individual units of code, such as functions, methods, and classes.
- Mock external dependencies to isolate the code being tested.
- Aim for a high level of code coverage, but don't sacrifice clarity or simplicity to achieve higher coverage.

## Integration Testing

- Write integration tests to verify the interaction between different parts of the system.
- Ensure that integrated components work together as expected.
- Use real instances of external dependencies where possible.

## End-to-End Testing

- Write end-to-end tests to verify the flow of an application from start to finish.
- Use automated tools like Selenium or Puppeteer to simulate real user behavior.

## Performance Testing

- Write performance tests to verify the system's responsiveness and stability under various conditions.
- Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the code accordingly.

## Code Coverage

- Strive for a high level of code coverage, but prioritize writing meaningful and effective tests over achieving a particular coverage percentage.
- Use tools like PHPUnit's code coverage or Istanbul for JavaScript to measure code coverage.

## Continuous Integration

- Set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automatically run tests on every push to the repository.
- Ensure that the CI pipeline provides clear feedback on the success or failure of the tests.
